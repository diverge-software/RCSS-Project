The unit_test project is setup to use WinUnit which should be located in: C:\WinUnit.  Be sure to disable your antivirus program when building and running the project as most do not like that mt.exe embeds the manifest in the dll.  In order for the test framework to run correctly, the manifest must be embededd.

Sample Output:

Tests run: 2; Failed: 0.
The program '[6044] WinUnit.exe: Native' has exited with code 0 (0x0).
